I am trying git and github in LINUX OS. This is the first file I (loaded) pushed to github.
The most challenging process to accomplish was copying the key created by ssh-keygen from the root directory. Serendipity is the keyword for how  I figured out just now to copy the key generated by ssh-keygen command and saved in root directory.
Many hits and trials finally a solution.
